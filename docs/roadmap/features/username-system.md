# Username System & Social Identity Roadmap

**Priority**: üî• **Critical** - Required for social platform evolution  
**Timeline**: Next 2-4 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Current auth system, social features already built  

---

## Overview

Tabsverse has evolved into a **social platform for digital curation** with public sharing, likes, comments, and discovery features. To unlock the full potential of these social features, we need a proper username system that enables user identity, attribution, and community building.

## Current State

### ‚úÖ **Social Features Already Built**
- Public curation sharing
- Like/unlike functionality  
- Comment system (database ready)
- View tracking and analytics
- User profiles (`/profile` route exists)
- Follow system (database ready)
- Public discovery/browse functionality

### ‚ùå **Missing Identity Layer**
- No usernames for public attribution
- Generic user display (email-based)
- No memorable user URLs (`/@username`)
- No public user profiles
- Limited social discovery capabilities

---

## The Username System

### **Phase 1: Core Username Infrastructure** 
*Timeline: Week 1-2*

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN username TEXT UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN display_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN bio TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN website TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT; -- if not already exists

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_display_name ON users(display_name);
```

#### Username Validation Rules
- **Length**: 3-20 characters
- **Format**: Alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens only
- **Case**: Case-insensitive storage, preserve display case
- **Reserved**: Block system words (`admin`, `api`, `help`, `about`, `settings`, `support`, etc.)
- **Unique**: Globally unique across platform

#### User Experience Flow
1. **New Users**: Username required during signup flow
2. **Existing Users**: Prompt for username on next login with auto-suggestions
3. **Profile Completion**: Encourage bio, avatar, display name for better discovery

### **Phase 2: Social URLs & Profiles**
*Timeline: Week 2-3*

#### New Route Structure
```
Current: /curations/uuid-123-456
New:     /@username/curation-slug

/profile ‚Üí /@username (redirect)
/@username ‚Üí User profile page
/@username/[slug] ‚Üí Pretty curation URLs
```

#### Public User Profiles
- Display all public curations
- User stats (total tabs curated, followers, following)
- Bio, website, join date
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Social proof (popular curations, recent activity)

#### URL Generation System
- Auto-generate curation slugs from titles
- Handle slug conflicts with numbering
- Redirect old UUID URLs to new pretty URLs
- Canonical URL support for SEO

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Social Features**
*Timeline: Week 3-4*

#### Discovery & Attribution
- Creator attribution on all public curations
- "More from @username" suggestions
- User search functionality
- Popular curators discovery page

#### Social Proof & Engagement
- User reputation based on likes, follows, views
- Featured curators program
- Top curations by creator
- Social sharing with proper attribution

## Technical Implementation

### **Username Availability API**
```typescript

{
  "username": "karina_dalca"
}
‚Üí { "available": true, "suggestions": ["karina_d", "karina_dalca1"] }
```

### **Username Claiming Flow**
```typescript
// For existing users
PATCH /api/users/me
{
  "username": "karina_dalca",
  "display_name": "Karina Dalca",
  "bio": "Building beautiful digital experiences"
}
```

### **URL Rewriting System**

## User Experience Considerations

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**

- **Performance**: Proper indexing and caching for username lookups

### **User Experience Risks**
- **Username Squatting**: Rate limiting and email verification
- **Change Requests**: Clear policy with grace period for mistakes
- **Privacy Concerns**: Opt-out of public discovery, private profiles

### **Business Risks**
- **Brand Protection**: Reserve key brand terms and competitor names
- **Legal Issues**: Username policy covering harassment, impersonation
- **Scalability**: Design system to handle millions of users from start
