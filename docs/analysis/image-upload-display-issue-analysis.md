# Image Upload & Display Issue Analysis

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ Images uploading but not displaying  
**Comparison**: Working Orate vs Non-working Tabsverse  

## Problem Statement

Images are uploading successfully to Supabase storage but:
1. ✅ Upload API working (files appear in Supabase Storage)
2. ✅ Database updates with URL (cover_image_url field populated)
3. ❌ Images not displaying in UI (falling back to category-based images)
4. ❌ No broken image indicators (suggests Next.js Image failing silently)

## Key Differences: Orate (Working) vs Tabsverse (Not Working)

### 1. **Storage Bucket Names**
- **Orate**: `playlist-images` 
- **Tabsverse**: `curation-images`

### 2. **Database Field Names**
- **Orate**: `cover_image` (direct field)
- **Tabsverse**: `cover_image_url` (URL suffix field)

### 3. **Next.js Image Configuration**
- **Orate**: Working with same Supabase CDN domain
- **Tabsverse**: May have domain configuration issues

### 4. **Image Display Logic**
- **Orate**: Simple conditional with fallback
- **Tabsverse**: Complex category-based fallback system

### 5. **Upload File Paths**
- **Orate**: `playlist-covers/filename.jpg`
- **Tabsverse**: `curation-covers/filename.ext`

## Diagnostic Steps Needed

### Step 1: Verify Next.js Image Domain Configuration
Check if Supabase CDN domains are properly configured in `next.config.js`

### Step 2: Test Image URL Accessibility  
Test if uploaded image URLs are accessible directly in browser

### Step 3: Check Console for Image Load Errors
Look for failed image load requests or CORS issues

### Step 4: Verify Database Data Format
Ensure URLs are being stored and retrieved correctly

## Likely Root Causes (In Order of Probability)

### 1. **Next.js Image Domain Configuration Issue**
- Most common cause of silent image failures
- Orate working suggests this domain should work
- Need to verify `next.config.js` configuration

### 2. **Database Field Mismatch**
- Code expects `coverImage` but database stores `cover_image_url`
- Transformation layer may have inconsistency

### 3. **URL Format Issues**
- Different file path structure between systems
- Invalid characters or encoding issues

### 4. **Storage Policy Access Issues**
- Despite public bucket, RLS may be interfering
- Different bucket configuration between systems

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Diagnostics (No DB Changes)
1. **Console Inspection**: Check for image load errors
2. **Direct URL Test**: Test uploaded image URLs in browser
3. **Network Tab**: Monitor failed image requests
4. **Database Verification**: Confirm URLs are correct format

### Phase 2: Configuration Fixes (If Needed)
1. **Next.js Config**: Update domain configuration
2. **Field Mapping**: Fix any database field mismatches  
3. **URL Format**: Standardize path structure

### Phase 3: Fallback System Fix (If Still Issues)
1. **Error Handling**: Add proper error states for failed images
2. **Logging**: Add detailed logging for debugging
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Improve fallback system

## Investigation Commands

### Check Current Next.js Configuration
```bash
cat /Users/karinadalca/Desktop/tabsverse/next.config.js
```

### Test Database Content
```sql
SELECT id, title, cover_image_url 
FROM groups 
WHERE cover_image_url IS NOT NULL 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Storage Bucket Contents
```sql
SELECT name, bucket_id, created_at 
FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'curation-images' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Expected Resolution

Based on the Orate working example, this is likely a simple configuration issue rather than a complex RLS or authentication problem. The systematic approach above should identify and resolve the issue without requiring database policy changes.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Uploaded images display in curation cards
- ✅ Images display in detailed curation pages  
- ✅ No console errors for image loading
- ✅ Graceful fallback to category images when no custom image
- ✅ No changes to storage policies required
