# Image Upload Debug Session

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Status**: 🔍 **DEBUGGING RANDOM BEHAVIOR**  
**Issue**: Sometimes broken links, sometimes Unsplash backups, inconsistent upload behavior

## 🚨 **Symptoms Reported**
- ✅ Next.js config updated with Supabase domains
- ❌ Still getting broken links randomly
- ❌ Sometimes shows Unsplash backup images instead of uploads
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior - "very random"

## 🔍 **Diagnostic Plan**

### **Step 1: Check Current Database State**
Let's see what URLs are actually stored in the database

### **Step 2: Verify Upload API Functionality**
Test if the upload API is working consistently

### **Step 3: Check Storage Bucket Contents**
Verify files are actually being uploaded to storage

### **Step 4: Test Image URL Accessibility**
Check if the URLs in database are actually accessible

### **Step 5: Examine Display Logic**
Look for race conditions or fallback logic issues

## 🧪 **Debug Commands Needed**

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor and report results:

### **A. Database Content Check**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  cover_image_url,
  primary_category,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM groups 
ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### **B. Storage Files Check**
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  bucket_id,
  created_at,
  metadata->>'size' as file_size,
  metadata->>'mimetype' as mime_type
FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'curation-images'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### **C. Storage Bucket Configuration**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  public,
  file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'curation-images';
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

Please run the commands above and share the results. Then we can:

1. **Identify the inconsistency source**
2. **Fix the upload workflow** 
3. **Ensure reliable image display**
4. **Test thoroughly** to prevent randomness

## 📝 **Information Needed**

1. **Console errors** when images fail to load
2. **Network tab** showing failed requests
3. **Database query results** from above
4. **Specific steps** that sometimes work vs sometimes fail
