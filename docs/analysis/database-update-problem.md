# Image Upload Issue: Database Update Problem

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Status**: 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**  
**Issue**: Files uploading to storage but database not updating with URLs

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

### **What's Working**:
- ✅ Files uploading to Supabase Storage successfully
- ✅ Files stored in correct path: `curation-covers/filename.jpg`
- ✅ File sizes look normal (38KB-52KB)

### **What's Broken**:
- ❌ Database `cover_image_url` field is `null` for all curations
- ❌ Upload API not updating database after successful file upload
- ❌ Display logic falls back to category images because no URL in database

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

The upload API is successfully uploading files but failing to update the curation record with the image URL.

## 📝 **Full URL Format**

Based on your Supabase project, the URLs should be:
```
https://qfkkywpzpklimtgdyyxi.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/curation-images/curation-covers/1750892035761-k1fywsaasni.jpg
```

## 🔧 **Fix Required**

Need to examine and fix the Create Curation flow to ensure:
1. Image uploads successfully ✅ (working)
2. Database gets updated with the image URL ❌ (broken)

## 🧪 **Test URL Accessibility**

Please test this URL directly in your browser:
```
https://qfkkywpzpklimtgdyyxi.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/curation-images/curation-covers/1750892035761-k1fywsaasni.jpg
```

This should show the uploaded image directly. If it does, then the storage is working perfectly and we just need to fix the database update.

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. Test the URL above
2. Examine the Create Curation modal upload logic
3. Fix the database update after successful upload
4. Test complete flow: upload → save → display
