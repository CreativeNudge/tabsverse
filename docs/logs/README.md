# Tabsverse Development Logs

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive logs of all development sessions for Tabsverse. The logging system is designed to provide clear historical tracking and easy session resumption.

## Logging Workflow

### Daily Sessions (001-999)
- Each development session gets a numbered log file
- Sessions are numbered sequentially within each day: `session-001.md`, `session-002.md`, etc.
- Maximum 999 sessions per day (highly unlikely to reach!)
- Each session log includes:
  - **Objectives**: What we planned to accomplish
  - **Actions Taken**: Step-by-step changes made
  - **Issues Encountered**: Problems and how they were resolved
  - **Outcomes**: What was accomplished
  - **Next Steps**: What to tackle in the next session

### Daily Summary
- Created at the end of each working day
- Combines all session logs into a cohesive daily summary
- Includes overall progress, key decisions, and priorities for next day
- Serves as the **primary reference** for resuming work

## Quick Start for New Sessions

### For Karina:
1. **Starting a new day**: Create folder `MM-DD-YYYY` 
2. **Starting a session**: Create `session-XXX.md` with next sequential number
3. **During session**: Document decisions, changes, and issues in real-time
4. **End of day**: Create `daily-summary.md` combining all sessions

### For Claude (AI Assistant):
1. **Session start**: Read the latest `daily-summary.md` to understand current state
2. **If no daily summary**: Read individual session logs from current day
3. **Context**: Use daily summaries to understand project evolution
4. **Logging**: Help document the current session as work progresses

## Benefits of This System

1. **Quick Context Recovery**: Daily summaries provide immediate project state
2. **Detailed Historical Record**: Individual sessions capture specific decisions
3. **Problem Resolution Tracking**: Easy to reference how similar issues were solved
4. **Progress Visibility**: Clear documentation of feature development
5. **Collaboration Continuity**: Anyone can pick up where work left off

## Log Content Guidelines

### Session Logs Should Include:
- **Date/Time**: When the session occurred
- **Duration**: How long the session lasted
- **Participants**: Who was involved (Karina, Claude, etc.)
- **Context**: What prompted this session
- **Technical Changes**: Code changes, file modifications, configuration updates
- **Decisions Made**: Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Testing Results**: What worked, what didn't
- **Issues/Blockers**: Problems encountered and resolution status

### Daily Summaries Should Include:
- **Overall Progress**: High-level achievements
- **Key Decisions**: Important technical or product choices
- **Completed Features**: What's now working
- **Known Issues**: What needs attention
- **Next Day Priorities**: What to focus on next
- **Architecture Changes**: Any significant structural modifications

## Integration with Development Workflow

This logging system complements the existing project documentation:
- **Memory Bank**: Long-term incident reports and safety guidelines
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture and API specifications
- **Session Logs**: Day-to-day development progress and decisions

## Starting Point: June 24, 2025

Today marks the **"big fix"** completion where we resolved the major authentication and API loop issues that were plaguing the application. This is our clean starting point with:

- ✅ Stable authentication using proven Mail Collectly patterns
- ✅ React Query for robust data fetching
- ✅ Type-safe API endpoints
- ✅ Production-ready build system
- ✅ Clean architecture foundation

All future sessions will build upon this stable foundation.
