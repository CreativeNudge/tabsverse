## 🐛 **Post-Session Bug Fix**

### **Issue Discovered**
After session completion, testing revealed that curation detail pages were showing "Curation not found" despite curations existing in the database.

### **Root Cause**
The `transformGroupToCollection` function in `/lib/utils/dataTransforms.ts` was truncating UUIDs from full length (e.g., `854b5c13-1234-5678-9abc-def123456789`) to just 8 characters (`854b5c13`) for "reasonable ID length". This caused a mismatch between the dashboard links and API expectations.

### **Fix Applied**
```typescript
// Before (broken)
id: group.id.length > 10 ? group.id.slice(0, 8) : group.id

// After (fixed)
id: group.id, // Use full UUID for proper routing
```

### **Impact**
✅ **Navigation from dashboard to detail pages now works correctly**  
✅ **All curation detail page features functional**  
✅ **Complete user flow operational**

**Status**: All features now working as intended! 🚀
