# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 1 Complete: Project Initialization** - Successfully set up the foundational architecture and development environment for Tabsverse using the proven stack and patterns from the successful collectly project.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ **Memory Bank Structure**: Created comprehensive documentation with all core files
- ✅ **Project Initialization**: Complete Next.js setup with proven collectly stack
- ✅ **Configuration Files**: All essential config files created and tested
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Full App Router architecture with organized folders
- ✅ **Brand Implementation**: Custom Tabsverse colors and styling
- ✅ **TypeScript Setup**: Comprehensive type definitions and strict configuration
- ✅ **Brand Foundation Complete**: Typography decision finalized with Inter as permanent font
- ✅ **Font Research**: Evaluated Galano Grotesque licensing (too complex/expensive) vs Inter (perfect free alternative)
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Variable font implementation via Next.js Google Fonts

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Test Local Development**: `cd /Users/karinadalca/Desktop/tabsverse && npm install && npm run dev`
2. **Initialize Git Repository**: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial project setup"`
3. **Connect GitHub**: `git remote add origin https://github.com/CreativeNudge/tabsverse.git && git push -u origin main`
4. **Setup Supabase Environment**: Configure `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
5. **Deploy to Vercel**: Connect GitHub repository and deploy
6. **Verify Production**: Test that deployment works error-free
7. **Begin Phase 2**: Authentication and user management implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Next.js 15.3.3**: Latest stable version, using App Router (proven in collectly)
- **TypeScript 5.3.3**: Strict mode for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.1**: Rapid styling with proven configuration
- **Supabase**: Database and authentication (project already created)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for seamless Next.js integration

### Architecture Decisions
- **App Router Structure**: Modern Next.js pattern with (dashboard) and (public) route groups
- **Component Organization**: shadcn/ui foundation with custom components
- **Database Design**: Social content management with collaborative features
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with session management
- **State Management**: React state + Server Actions (proven pattern)

### Development Approach
- **Documentation First**: Maintain comprehensive Memory Bank throughout development
- **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally with working deployments
- **Clean Code Focus**: Reusable, well-documented, organized code
- **Production Ready**: Local development → GitHub → Vercel workflow

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### From Collectly Success Patterns
- **Proven Dependency Versions**: Exact version matching to avoid TypeScript/ESLint conflicts
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Custom brand colors and component styling
- **Component Architecture**: UI components in `/components/ui/`, feature components organized by domain
- **Database Patterns**: Supabase with RLS, structured data models
- **API Design**: RESTful API routes with proper error handling

### Project-Specific Patterns
- **Social Features**: Community-driven content discovery and sharing
- **Collaborative Collections**: Real-time collaboration on shared resources
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Seamless access across all user devices
- **Resource Organization**: Flexible tagging and categorization systems
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular visibility and sharing permissions

## Current Understanding

### Project Scope
Tabsverse is a social web content management platform that combines:
- Personal organization (like Pocket)
- Visual curation (like Pinterest)
- Link sharing (like Linktree)
- Collaborative features (unique value proposition)

### Key Differentiators
- **All-in-One Solution**: Multiple tool capabilities in one platform
- **Social Discovery**: Community-curated content discovery
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live collaborative collection building
- **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Universal access to organized content

### Target Users
- Knowledge workers and researchers
- Students and educators
- Digital creators and designers
- Collaborative teams
- Community curators

## Development Environment Status
- **Local Directory**: `/Users/karinadalca/Desktop/tabsverse` ✅ Complete project setup
- **GitHub Repository**: `https://github.com/CreativeNudge/tabsverse` (ready for initial push)
- **Project Files**: All configuration and source files created ✅
- **Dependencies**: package.json with exact proven versions ✅
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration matching collectly ✅
- **Tailwind**: Custom Tabsverse branding configured ✅
- **Supabase Project**: Ready for environment configuration
- **Vercel Account**: Ready for deployment
- **Figma Files**: Available for UI implementation reference

## Known Constraints and Considerations
- **Version Compatibility**: Must use exact dependency versions from collectly to avoid conflicts
- **Figma Implementation**: UI will be built from provided Figma designs
- **Supabase Integration**: Database and auth setup needs to match project architecture
- **Performance Targets**: Social features require real-time performance optimization
- **Scalability**: Architecture must support community growth and collaborative features

## Project Phases (Anticipated)
1. **Phase 1**: Project initialization and basic structure
2. **Phase 2**: Authentication and user management
3. **Phase 3**: Core collection and resource management
4. **Phase 4**: Social features and sharing
5. **Phase 5**: Collaborative features and real-time updates
6. **Phase 6**: Community discovery and advanced features

## Memory Bank Maintenance Notes
- All core Memory Bank files created and comprehensive
- Technical context matches proven collectly stack exactly
- System patterns designed for social/collaborative features
- Product context clearly defines user value propositions
- This activeContext.md tracks current state and decisions

**Ready to begin project initialization with proven stack and clean architecture approach.**
