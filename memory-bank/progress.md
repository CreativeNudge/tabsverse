## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Local Testing & Deployment

### Phase 1 Achievements âœ…
1. âœ… **Clean Setup**: Project structure created with proven stack
2. âœ… **Proven Stack**: Exact dependency versions from successful collectly
3. âœ… **Configuration**: All essential config files properly set up
4. âœ… **Brand Implementation**: Custom Tabsverse styling and colors
5. âœ… **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Local Testing**: Install dependencies and verify development server
2. **Git Setup**: Initialize repository and connect to GitHub
3. **Production Deploy**: Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel
4. **Environment Setup**: Configure Supabase connection

### Known Considerations
- **Version Compatibility**: Critical to use exact versions from collectly
- **Project Structure**: Follow proven patterns for scalability
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout
- **Iterative Approach**: Each phase must work completely before proceeding

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js App Router**: Modern routing with (dashboard) and (public) groups
- **Supabase Integration**: Database, authentication, and real-time features
- **Social-First Design**: Built for sharing and collaboration from the ground up
- **Component Architecture**: shadcn/ui foundation with custom feature components

### Development Philosophy
- **Documentation First**: Comprehensive Memory Bank maintenance
- **Quality Over Speed**: Clean, reusable, well-organized code
- **Production Ready**: Every phase deploys successfully
- **Proven Patterns**: Learn from collectly's successful architecture

### Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports community growth
- **Performance**: Real-time features require optimization
- **Mobile Experience**: Progressive web app capabilities
- **Integrations**: Browser extension and third-party APIs

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Using proven dependency versions from collectly
- **Scope Risk**: Clearly defined phases with specific deliverables
- **Quality Risk**: Comprehensive documentation and testing approach
- **Timeline Risk**: Iterative development with working deployments

**Status: Ready to begin Phase 1 with complete planning and proven technical foundation.**
